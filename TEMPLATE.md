*From the inventory*: 
    1 pinch salt (to taste)
    1 pinch pepper (to taste)
*Need to purchase*:
    Package of bacon strips (at least 6)


Directions
----------
Wrap the bottom of the baking sheet in the aluminium foil. (optional)
Place cooling rack on baking sheet.
Spread bacon evenly across cooling rack.
Place baking sheet, cooling rack, and bacon in a *cold* oven.
Turn oven on to 400deg. Fahrenheit.
When the oven comes to temperature, check bacon. 
	If still raw, leave in an additional 2 - 5 minutes.

If you lined the baking sheet with the aluminium foil, allow the foil and sheet to cool, peel the foil up, and throw away. This will significantly reduce the amount of cleanup necessary.
