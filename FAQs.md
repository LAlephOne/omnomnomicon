What's the goal here?
--------------------- 
After moving earlier this year, I found it difficult to bring myself back up to speed with repopulating my kitchen and knocking the rust off of my cooking skills. Additionally with no pantry to speak of, I wished there was something that would incrementally build up my equipment, skills, and pantry over a long enough period of time that I could absorb cooking again into my life without just being presented with a list of ingredients and instructions in an encyclopedic format. I'd also started reading [Zed Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw)'s excellent [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/) series for work and wondered why nobody had done something similar for cooking.



How does this differ from the existing [Reddit College Cookbook](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2jui/remember_the_post_yesterday_about_recipes_for/)?
--------------------------------------------------------------
There are a /lot/ of suggestions for [Reddit cookbooks](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=reddit+cookbook). I'm not going to lie, this is very very similar in idea and scope. The difference here (I hope) is that we'll be moving away from more of a "compendium" style cookbook and more toward a curated instruction manual for someone who has just started cooking in their own kitchen. Ideally, I'd like to start with the understanding that the reader only has a fridge, oven, and stove to work with and go from there; slowly introducing equipment, items to the pantry, and skills as the user reads through the book.



So I heard you like hearding cats?
----------------------------------
While asking everyone to dump recipes into yet another reddit might be effective, it's been done before and really isn't what is intended for the scope of this project. It would make more sense to dedicate [the reddit](http://reddit.com/r/omnomnomicon_book) to something similar to what [/r/52weeksofcooking](http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/) is doing. 

At the start of each week a post will be made with the current inventory levels of the pantry and equipment already owned/purchased at that point in time based on the prior weeks. Anyone then, can [submit recipes](http://www.reddit.com/r/omnomnomicon_book/submit) with those suggestions in mind. If your recipe needs additional ingredients, just specify which ones are coming from "the pantry" and which are to be purchased.

The recipes that are best received and best incorporate the ideals of the project will be archived on our [GitHub project page](https://github.com/LAlephOne/omnomnomicon) and the inventory levels will be recalculated based off of the contents at that point. Think of it as a weekly checkpointing system to get us all back on the same page.



Wait, wait, GitHub? What are you, some kinda nerd?
--------------------------------------------------
Well, yeah. Additionally, this will allow the book to [come together naturally](http://www.eqqon.com/index.php/Collaborative_Github_Workflow), organically, and have a source of collaborative trouth without the worries of trolls killing a hosted wiki or the like. It also means that if you'd like to fork the project off to start a [Veg(itari)an version](http://www.reddit.com/r/VegRecipes/comments/lwsxm/reddit_veggie_college_cookbook/), [Paleo version](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/tj1fq/paleo_iron_chef_challenge_cookbook_compiled/), or a [Bacon version](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=bacon+cookbook&restrict_sr=off&sort=relevance) you can do so very easily.

Don't want to get that down and dirty? Don't worry, you can just follow along the reddit for inspiration and the recipes submitted may not match the contents of your pantry perfectly, but you will likely have a very close approximation of the prerequisites.
