Checkpoint 0
============

Wecome to week 0. With no equipment or stores in the pantry, the world is wide open to you. Additionally since we will need to start off with some equipment, this first week will have a higher than average shopping budget to give options for starter equipment costs. Remember, though: you can't cook without equipment and you won't have anything to cook if you spend it all on the equipment. The goal here will be to strike a good balance.

As a guideline for the week, all included recipes and shopping lists should have the expectations of the following:

Equipment available:
--------------------
* Refrigerator
* Oven
* Stovetop

Pantry available:
-----------------
* None

Shopping Budget:
----------------
$150
