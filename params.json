{"name":"Omnomnomicon","body":"omnomnomicon\r\n============\r\n\r\nWe've all had to start somewhere. Be it learning to play an instrument, ride a bike, or cook for yourself. Though there have been plenty of books written on all of these, there is often nothing better than jumping in and getting your hands dirty to really introduce you to a practice. It's in the spirit of [Zed Shaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw)'s excellent [Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/) series that this is written.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book will be written with the presumption that you are at \"starving student\" levels of monetary, equipment, and time budgets. The goal is to present a shopping list at that start of every chapter that will be the prerequisites for the dishes that the chapter will contain. Each chapter will contain 5 - 7 dishes to be cooked at some point that week. As the book progresses, so will the difficulty of the dishes that you will be creating and the amount of equipment that you will acquire. By the end of the book you will have gained the skills necessary to create your own dishes, learned how to shop economically and nutritionally, and have a fully stocked set of kitchen equipment and pantry to provide the necessary foundation for your further experimentations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA book this ambitious is a collaborative effort.
