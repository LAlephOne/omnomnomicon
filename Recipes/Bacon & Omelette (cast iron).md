Directions
----------
If your Cast Iron skillet isn't a hand-me-down from your grandmother, do yourself a favor and make sure it gets [seasoned properly](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/) (with SCIENCE). Cast iron (as stated above) will last practically forever, is capable of going from stovetop to oven to table (with hot-pad), and will hold an even temperature no matter what type of burner/surface you're cooking on. It's also cheap as all get-out compared to other pans. I got mine at a home improvement store for a song. Lastly, it's [easier than you'd think](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=PiQ0VOJmCbg#t=540s) to clean (no sink time or dishwasher required!)

Silicone will survive in almost any environment as well. When choosing a silicone spatula, make sure you find one that is a solid piece (rather than stick-in-silicone-head) so that it doesn't fall apart or get food bits inside of it.

Pyrex has recently [changed their formula](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2011-03/gray-matter-cant-take-heat), so check to see if you can get some from your local thrift store or as a hand-me down if possible (if you see the name "Corning" you're golden). Nonetheless, the tough is strong and dourable and likewise is safe to use in the oven, microwave, refrigerator, freezer and dishwasher.


The key to cooking bacon and not having it dry out and curl is to make certain you're cooking it on low, even heat. Cast iron will be great for this because it will maintain a constant, even temperature while your stovetop likely cycles on and off.

Start by placing a dab of the butter (~0.25oz.) on the cast iron skillet and turning the heat up to medium-high.

Allow the surface to heat until the butter melts.

Spread melted butter around the surface of the skillet and continue heating until the butter smells "nutty".

As soon as you can smell this, turn the temperature of the burner down to medium-low and place your slices of bacon into the skillet.

Flip the bacon every 60 seconds or so until most of the fat is rendered out and the bacon is maple-brown.

Take bacon out of skillet and place on a paper towel.

Adjust skillet heat to low and leave bacon grease in pan.

Open can of mixed vegetables and drain of as much liquid as possible.

Empty can into skillet and allow veggies to reheat, stirring regularly (1 - 2 minutes).

While veggies are reheating, crack two eggs into mixing bowl.

Add a few shakes of salt & pepper to mixing bowl to your own personal preference.

Beat eggs until their color is even and yolk is entirely mixed into whites.

Pour eggs into skillet, attempting to spread evenly across surface. If necessary, pick up skillet and turn it to run the liquid eggs into any areas you've missed.

Allow eggs & veggies to cook without touching. Seriously. Don't touch it until you notice the corners of the surface firming up, but the middle/top of the eggs barely still soft.

Use spatula to run around the edge of the eggs and as far underneath as you can without disturbing the eggs.

Try to fold the eggs in half. This step will take practice and you may not get it right until you've done this a few times.

Pick up pan and slide onto plate with bacon.
