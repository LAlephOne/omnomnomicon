Directions
----------
If your Cast Iron skillet isn't a hand-me-down from your grandmother, do yourself a favor and make sure it gets [seasoned properly](http://sherylcanter.com/wordpress/2010/01/a-science-based-technique-for-seasoning-cast-iron/) (with SCIENCE). Cast iron (as stated above) will last practically forever, is capable of going from stovetop to oven to table (with hot-pad), and will hold an even temperature no matter what type of burner/surface you're cooking on. It's also cheap as all get-out compared to other pans. I got mine at a home improvement store for a song. Lastly, it's [easier than you'd think](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=PiQ0VOJmCbg#t=540s) to clean (no sink time or dishwasher required!)

Silicone will survive in almost any environment as well. When choosing a silicone spatula, make sure you find one that is a solid piece (rather than stick-in-silicone-head) so that it doesn't fall apart or get food bits inside of it.


Pre-heat cast iron skillet on stovetop at medium heat.

Spread 0.5oz. butter a single side of each of the slices of bread.

Place single slice butter-side-down on skillet.

While bread toasts, grate ~1oz. of cheese with the smallest face of your grater.

Check on the grilled side of the bread and if the bread looks almost-toasted, place grated cheese on non-butter side of bread and top with other slice of sourdough (also butter-side-out).

Wait 30 seconds, then flip sandwich.

Allow sandwich to toast each slice of bread, flipping as necessary (though avoid flipping if possible to prevent cheese leakage).

Slide sandwich out onto plate and enjoy.
