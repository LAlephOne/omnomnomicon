omnomnomicon Rules
==================

First and foremost, there is to be no harassment during the project. That should come as no surprise to anyone, but the internets are serious business and sometimes things that you think you can take for granted still need to be said.

The reddit has been made text only, but feel free to link to imgur whenever you'd like to show off what you've created. You should feel proud of the dishes you prepare and I'm not one to tell you to not strut what you've got.

In general, posts should follow the standard template. Those posts that don't follow the format will be removed. If you'd like to bring up discussion, there will be the weekly checkpointing thread that will be open to general conversation and chat.

Additionally, recipes that require unitasker equipment or need much more equipment than is currently available will likely not make it into the weekly checkpoint. Feel free to re-submit at a later point when the equipment inventory is more mature, but don't feel bad if your recipe isn't picked when it may be a great recipe that simply breaks this week's budget.
